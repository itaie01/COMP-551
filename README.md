This is my repository for my Mila Research Masters supervision request.

The contents of the repository are a jupyter notebook containing my work from COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning at McGill University. It contains a decision tree implementation, an MLP implementation, and textual data analysis on IMDB reviews.
